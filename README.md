# HKUST-ELEC3300-Introduction-to-Embedded-Systems

[Course Introduction]:

This course is designed to teach techniques on how to integrate machine-level software and hardware in ARM-core microcontroller based systems. It makes use of industry-standard techniques and technologies, from which students can interface, design and program microcontroller systems. The task of the course will be to complete six laboratory experiments which address different aspects of hardware/software interfacing, and one large microprocessor/microcontroller based project which should result in the design and implementation of a small working embedded system.
